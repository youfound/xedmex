              At Xedmex we're working hard, and we want to give you a sneak peek
              into what's coming up - the Mobile Apps!<br />
              <br />
              Launch Date: Q1 2024<br />
              <br />
              Mobile apps for both Google Play and Apple App Store are well
              underway and are set to launch in the first quarter of 2024.<br />
              <br />
              What you can expect:<br />
              <br />
              1. Impeccable Quality: We're committed to delivering a smooth
              experience for our users. Our development team is rigorously
              testing and refining the apps UX to set the highest standards.<br />
              <br />
              2. User-Centric Features: We listen to our community feedback and
              are incorporating some cutting-edge new features to enhance you
              trading experience with Xedmex. It's all about making trading even
              easier and more enjoyable.<br />
              <br />
              3. Cross-Platform Compatibility: Developing for both Android and
              iOS is a complex task, but it's worth it. We want to make sure
              everyone can enjoy our apps, no matter what device they use.<br />
              <br />
              4. Security and Privacy: We're taking data protection seriously.
              Our team is implementing state-of-the-art security measures to
              keep your funds and personal information safe - always.<br />
              <br />
              5. Instant Access: Our app will be launched as the ultimate,
              fully-refined product. No demos, trials or promises, but 100%
              ready to go product on both platforms - Apple Store and Google
              Play. Thanks to our dedicated dev team and selected users who will
              be testing the app during development time, you can expect nothing
              but the best right from the start!<br />
              <br />
              Stay tuned for more updates as we get closer to the launch date!

              We are excited to introduce you to our Virtual Trading feature,
              designed to help you familiarize yourself with our platform before
              diving into real trading with your own capital.<br />
              <br />
              What is Virtual Trading?<br />
              <br />
              Virtual Trading allows you to simulate real trading experiences on
              Xedmex without risking your actual capital. It's a risk-free way
              to explore and understand how our Xedmex AI Trader works and
              evaluate the performance of our trading bot, all while using
              virtual currency.<br />
              <br />
              Getting Started<br />
              <br />
              When you open an account with Xedmex, you automatically receive
              100,000 Virtual Dollars (vUSD). Each vUSD is equivalent to one US
              dollar, so you start with a substantial amount to experiment
              with.<br />
              <br />
              How to Use Virtual Trading<br />
              <br />
              Navigate to the Virtual Trading Section: Log in to your Xedmex AI
              account, and you'll find the Virtual Trading button in your
              dashboard.<br />
              <br />
              Create Virtual Deposits: You can use your vUSD to create virtual
              deposits. These virtual deposits will mimic real deposits and work
              with our trading bot in the same way, as real capital deposits.<br />

              In the ever-evolving world of technology, Apple Inc. has remained
              a pioneer and a trendsetter. The anticipation for each new iPhone
              release is akin to a cultural phenomenon, and this year is no
              different. Apple enthusiasts and investors worldwide are eagerly
              awaiting the launch of the iPhone 15, poised to take the market by

              Labor Day, celebrated on the first Monday of September, is a
              time-honored American holiday dedicated to honoring the labor and
              trade union movements and the works and contributions of laborers
              to the development and achievements of the United States. Beyond
              the barbecues and parades, it's also a significant day for
              financial markets, including the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
              and other major exchanges.<br />
              <br />
              A Day of Rest for the Markets<br />
              <br />
              On Labor Day, the NYSE and various other stock markets in the U.S.
              come to a temporary halt. It's one of the 11 federal holidays when
              these markets remain closed. This break allows traders and
              investors to take a breather and reflect on the importance of
              their hard work.<br />
              <br />
              Trading Resumes on September 5th<br />
              <br />
              If you're a trader, it's essential to note that trading activities
              on these major exchanges won't take place on Labor Day, which
              falls on September 4th this year. Instead, you can look forward to
              the markets reopening at their usual times on the next business
              day, which is Tuesday, September 5th.<br />
              <br />
              Plan Your Trading Strategy Accordingly<br />
              <br />
              While the markets may be closed on Labor Day, it's an excellent
              opportunity for traders and investors to strategize and prepare
              for the days ahead. Use this time to analyze market trends, review
              your portfolio, and fine-tune your trading strategy. Consider how
              global events and news might impact your investments, and be ready
              to make informed decisions when trading resumes.<br />
              <br />
              Discover the Power of Automation with Xedmex<br />
              <br />

              contributions of workers, remember that trading will resume on
              September 5th. Use this time wisely to plan your investment moves,

              Independence Day, the 4th of July, is a momentous occasion in the
              United States when we commemorate the nation's birth and the
              hard-won freedom we cherish. It's a day filled with fireworks,
              parades, and patriotic festivities. But for traders and investors,
              it's also a reminder of the dynamism of financial markets and the
              opportunities they present.<br />
              <br />
              Markets in Full Swing<br />
              <br />
              On Independence Day, the financial markets in the U.S. remain
              closed to honor this historic day. Just like on Labor Day, this
              pause gives traders and investors a chance to pause and reflect on
              the significance of their work in the context of freedom and
              opportunity.<br />
              <br />
              Trading Resumes on July 5th<br />
              <br />
              For traders, it's vital to remember that trading activities will
              be suspended on July 4th. Markets will reopen for regular business
              hours on the following day, July 5th. This presents an ideal
              window to strategize and position your trades for the days
              ahead.<br />
              <br />
              Strategize and Optimize<br />
              <br />
              With the markets temporarily closed, use this time wisely to
              review your trading strategy. Assess market trends, reevaluate
              your portfolio, and stay updated on global events that could
              impact your investments. Independence Day serves as a reminder
              that freedom and independence are also about having the autonomy
              to make informed choices in your financial endeavors.<br />
